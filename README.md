SimpleGameEngine
================

Simple and easy to use game engine written in C++

Designed with the following principles in mind:

* Easy to use
* Follows Object Oriented design principles
* Cross platform
* Very little boilerplate code


This project relies on the following libraries:

* [glfw](http://www.glfw.org/)


There is a sample project for this [here](https://github.com/C0deH4cker/Ballz).
And now there is a [Flappy Bird clone](https://github.com/C0deH4cker/FlappingBird) too!


###TODO:

* Add a SpriteBatch class to make rendering textures faster
* Fullscreen support
* Allow drawing text
